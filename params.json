(This is what is used to calculate the WAC.)\r\nMachineDisk:: Represents a disk on the Machine that is used for storage or a mounted image for loading additional software.\r\nMachineDiskReading:: Represents the activity of the specific disk/mounted image or MachineDisk.\r\nMachineNic:: Represents a network interface on the machine.\r\nMachineNicReading:: Represents the activity of the specific network interface or MachineNic.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the 6fusion Adaptor Template, simply...\r\n\r\n* Fork the latest version from github\r\n* $ git checkout \\{forked_repository\\}\r\n* Modify to suit\r\n\r\n## JRuby Configuration w/ RVM\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to use a Java library for interaction with your cloud service, you'll want to run this REST service as a jruby application.  To do so is pretty simple.\r\n\r\n* In the Gemfile you'll want to switch from the 'thin' gem to the 'trinidad' gem.\r\n  * Comment Out Line #4 (gem 'thin' # or mongrel)\r\n  * Uncomment Line #5 (gem 'trinidad', :platform => 'jruby')\r\n* If you are using rvm you'll want to also uncomment a line in the .rvmrc file in the root of the project.\r\n  * Line #22 (PROJECT_JRUBY_OPTS=( --1.9 ).\r\n* Finally if you haven't done so run this command in your shell client.\r\n  * chmod +x ${rvm_path}/hooks/after_use_jruby_opts\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nIn order to use the template it is really simple.  All you need to do is navigate to the models folder of your checkout and modify the class methods on the models to implement the requested information.  You can use the yard documentation to get an idea of what to implement or read the comments above each of the methods.\r\n\r\nYou can access the yard documentation either through building it with the yard gem or using the hosted [yard documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/6fusion/adaptor-template/master/frames).\r\n\r\nFor additonal information that may be helpful developing your adaptor look here: [Adaptor Template - Wiki](https://github.com/6fusion/adaptor-template/wiki)\r\n\r\n** Do NOT modify the INode model unless you have a specific storage strategy.  This is the only model where a basic implementation has already been done for you.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 6fusion, Inc.
